# üîé How To Use:
1.	Users select a specific date and can write a diary if there is no diary written down on that day. Tapping the date on the calendar will move the users from the Main(calendar) screen to the Writing Diary screen.
2.	After writing a diary, Users input the keyword and emotion about the day. Users can input their own emotion and the keyword or have automatically generated ones by pressing the auto button.
3.	When users press the Done button on the top, everything they have written is saved and the emotion and keyword are marked on the calendar of the Main screen.
4.	If users tap the date which has written diary, they can check the diary content, keyword, and emotion as well as summarized sentences for the diary.
5.	If users want to revise a keyword or emotion for the diary, they can tab the Edit button on the top.
6.	If users want to delete the diary, they can tab the Delete button on the top.
7.	If users want to change the color of an emotion, they go in to the Setting screen by tapping Setting button on the bottom navigation bar. Then, they tap the ‚Äúselect color for emotion‚Äù menu and can select color to change for the emotion.

# ‚úèÔ∏è Application Limitations:
<ul type="disc">
<li> The accuracy of the extracting function is not good enough. </li>
<li> Extracted keywords may not be the real main keyword of the diary, and summary sentence may not include the overall content because it just extracts the one key sentence from the whole diary entries. </li>
<li> Only Happy and Angry are automatically extracted and its accuracy is low. </li>
<li> We could not implement Password and Notification function of Setting. </li>
