## üîé How To Use:
1.	Users select a specific date and can write a diary if there is no diary written down on that day. Tapping the date on the calendar will move the users from the Main(calendar) screen to the Writing Diary screen.

3.	When users press the Done button on the top, everything they have written is saved and the emotion and keyword are marked on the calendar of the Main screen.
4.	If users tap the date which has written diary, they can check the diary content, keyword, and emotion as well as summarized sentences for the diary.
5.	If users want to revise a keyword or emotion for the diary, they can tab the Edit button on the top.
6.	If users want to delete the diary, they can tab the Delete button on the top.
7.	If users want to change the color of an emotion, they go in to the Setting screen by tapping Setting button on the bottom navigation bar. Then, they tap the ‚Äúselect color for emotion‚Äù menu and can select color to change for the emotion.
